# Day 3 - Getting deeper into ARM templates

## Introduction

I have an Azure IaaS deployment coming up soon and have had variable results with ARM templates in the past. Microsoft have Azure Bicep coming down the tracks soon, but at the moment it not available for production deployments.

## Prerequisite

Some basic Azue knowledge and a desire to learn


## Cloud Research

I tried the Microsoft Learn series on ARM and it just doesn't go deep enough.


## Try yourself

Sam Cogan has put together a comprehensive series on ARM template development and deployment. You can check it out here.
