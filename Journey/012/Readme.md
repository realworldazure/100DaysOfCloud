# Day 12 - Cheatin' GIT

## Introduction

Spent some time this evening doing a deeper dive into git and found this really useful Git Cheat Sheet. (ink below)

## Prerequisite

Knowing and understanding GIT basics. If you can use the basics and understand the flow and theory, you should be OK just refering to the sheet.


## Cloud Research

There is a lot of information out there but I haven't really found anything super clear. I though MadebyGPS 100DaysOfCLoud video on the subject was good. I think if you've seen that and use the sheet you should be OK.
