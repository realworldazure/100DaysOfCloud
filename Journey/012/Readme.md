# Day 12 - Cheatin' GIT

## Introduction

[12/100] #100DaysOfCloud Bit of a detour today. Trying to get familiar with Linux development so setup Git on Debian and managed to find this neat 'Cheat Sheet' that is worth bookmarking.

## Prerequisite

Knowing and understanding GIT basics. If you can use the basics and understand the flow and theory, you should be OK just refering to the sheet.


## Cloud Research

There is a lot of information out there but I haven't really found anything super clear. I though MadebyGPS 100DaysOfCLoud video on the subject was good. I think if you've seen that and use the sheet you should be OK.
