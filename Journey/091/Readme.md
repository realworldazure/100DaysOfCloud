# Day 91 - Learning Python

## Introduction

As part of the AZ-400 study I am approaching all the learning from multiple angles. Having gone through the modules in the cloudskills DevOps course, I am not working through the 37 or so MS Learn DevOps courses.

## Prerequisite

No pre-requisites at all for this. I suggest taking the Getting Started with Azure DevOps course first.


## Cloud Research

Again, for Microsoft Learning requirements Learn is always worth checking out first.
