## Introduction

Microsoft's Well Architected Framework can feel a little overwhelming, but much of it is very useful indeed. I found an excellent section that helps you make 'Technology Choices'. My pick of the bunch is one that focuses on 'Choosing compute' and I've posted a link below

## Prerequisite

Not much, but it may help to understand some of the Azure Compute Services


## Cloud Research

## Try yourself

	- Bind a domain to your onmicrosoft.com AD tenant so you can use your domain's prefix
	- Invite guest user
	- Login with user and check what access they have (should not be able to see anyone else in AAD for a start)
	- Create new AD instance within your tenant and assign/create a new Subscription to it
    - Change your Subscription to a New Tenant
