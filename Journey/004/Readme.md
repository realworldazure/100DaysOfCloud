# Day 4 and its all about the Well Architected Framework

## Introduction

In two weeks I have to run an architecture workshop for a client. I need to come out of the workshop having determined the optimum target infrastructure. I've viewed the Well Architected Framework (WAF) a number of times, but never really got to grips with it. Today was about addressing that.

## Use Case

If your goal is to check how an existing application adheres (or does not) to Mcrosoft best practice, the WAF can help. If you have a new app and you want deployment advice, it is good for that too.

## Cloud Research

The WAF can be found here [Well Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/framework/)

I would take this approach to learning about it.

1) Take a brief overview of the 5 Pillars (following the link above)
2) Conduct an assessment. This will really help reinforce the concepts -> [WAF Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&session=7aa2e31f-14f2-48a1-9586-2a4c1e9c70b7)
3) Go back and do a deeper dive once you have run through an assessment.
