The exploits of Day 2

## Introduction

On Day 1 I managed to 'go through the motions' with Git in order to clone my 100days repo, branch, edit, commit etc. I wasn't super confident that I was really on top of it having done it only once,  so today I worked to really reinforce the knowledge I gained yesterday.

## Use Case

The use case is simply become more confident and fluid with the whole process for managing version control with Git.

## Cloud Research

I refered to Gwenyth's intro video for 100 days of cloud, slowed it right down, and made some notes.

## Git Learning
The process I used for #100DaysOfCloud version control

From Github "100daysofcloud/100daysofcloud"
1. Check "use this template"
2. Set scope to Public
3. Hit "Create repo from template"
4. Hit Code and "clone from HTTPS://

From Command Prompt

Go into command prompt and move a directory where you wish to do the clone

5. Enter "git clone <https://github.com/realworldazure/100DaysOfCloud.git>" to clone the repository
6. Move into the Folder "100DaysOfCloud"
7. Enter "git checkout -b day1" to create a new branch
8. Enter "code ." to open up the Project in VS Code

In VS Code Make all the changes you need to the readme

9. Enter "git add ." to add all your changes
10. Enter "git commit -m  "Added day x of journey" to add a description to the change
11. Enter "git checkout main" to checkout the main branch
12. Enter "git merge day x" to merge your changes
13. Enter "git push" to push your changes
