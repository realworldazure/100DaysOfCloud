# Day 5 and I'm focusing on AZ-104

## Introduction

Having finished the Ignite Challenge it is back to Microsoft Learn. Picking up some new skills and covering some old... My next cert is AZ-104.


## Use Case

If you are interested in the AZ-104 certification I'd recommend, as always, checking out Microsoft Learn first. The link below takes you to the AZ-104 pre-requisites page

## Cloud Research

Lots of great resources out there. My favourite course is the AZ-104 that can be found at Cloudskills.io. You can also use the Whizlabs AZ-104 practice tests. Be warned though, I think the actual exam questions are tougher. Well, at the time of writing anyway.
