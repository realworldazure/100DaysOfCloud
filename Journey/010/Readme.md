# Day 10 - A Deep'ish dive into SD-WAN

## Introduction

I am helping out scope a PoC for a client soon. Whilst I am familiar with SD-WAN and have gone through a full lifecycle implementation, there is always a lot to learn. I am a fan of the Day2Cloud series, so thought I'd give this a go. It didn't disappoint, and the role play of customer & cloud consultant really worked.

## Prerequisite

It is technical and there are a few terms that are unique to SD-WAN. But it is worth persevering, especially if SD-WAN is on your 'roadmap'.


## Cloud Research

Lots of videos on youtube. Many seem to be very vendor specific. Also a Dummies book for SD-WAN by Velocloud. Which is pretty good
